# Country Facts Website
This website displays details and an interactable map for a specified country.

### This website meets the following MSA requirements for the frontend phase 2 project.
#### 1. Create a new typescript and react web app
This website uses the React framework and Typescript.

#### 2. Connect this application to a different 3rd party RESTful Web API
This website connects to the [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) API to retrieve the country data.

#### 3. Allow users to input information that will be utilized by the API
The user inputs the country name. The API is then called to retrieve the specified country's data. This data is then displayed to the user.

#### 4. Make use of a UI library like Material-UI.
Since this is a simple website, all formatting was done through the Material-UI components. Notably, the text-field and the country display card both strongly utilise the Material-UI.

#### 5. Utilize source control through GitHub.
Commits to git were done at key points in the development. This made it easy to revert changes if needed and allowed easy project tracking. Since this was a simple website and I was the only developer, I did not see the need to create any branches.

To run this website, clone the code, then run the following script in the directory.
`npm start`

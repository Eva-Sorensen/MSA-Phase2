In object-oriented programming, dependency injection is a useful process that simplifies your code by supplying a resource, called a dependency, that the code requires. 
The benefit of using dependency injection is that it allows you to code without worrying about the task of instantiating the dependencies. This has the added benefits of:
* Allowing the dependencies to be swapped out easily, making maintenance and unit testing easier.  
* Since the framework does the dependency instantiation, the configuration data is centralised, further making maintenance easier.

Middleware refers to the dependencies added to the ASP.Net API pipeline. These are available to be used in your custom classes through dependency injection. ASP.Net core injects these dependencies through the custom classâ€™s constructor. This simplifies the code hugely because, as mentioned above, the dependencies are easy to set up and use, as we do not need to worry about instantiation. The dependencies are all in the same place and are simple to swap out.
